#### The backend we built in Phase 3

![learn-backend-javascript](./learn-backend-java-script-9-638.webp)

With SQLAlchemy as our ORM, we built the above, except instead of a Web Server, we scripted a CLI application to interact with our ORM.

##### Our goal: Full-Stack Applications!

![full-stack](./full-stack.jpg)

We still need something like `json-server` which can bridge the gap between front and back end and complete the **Request-Response Cycle**

The **Web Server Gateway Interface** provided by **Werkzeug** will be able to handle the HTTP traffic to our web server.
